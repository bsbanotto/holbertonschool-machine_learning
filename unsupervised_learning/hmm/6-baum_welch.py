    Imagine you have a special puzzle with different pieces, but the pieces are
    hidden from you. You know how the puzzle works: when you put two pieces
    together, they make a sound or show a picture. However, you don't know
    which pieces fit together or what sounds or pictures they make.

    Now, let's say you want to figure out how the puzzle works by observing the
    sounds or pictures it produces. This is where the Baum-Welch algorithm
    comes in!
    Args:
        Observations: numpy.ndarray shape (T,) that contains the index of the
            observation
            T: Number of observations
        Transition: numpy.ndarray shape (M, M) that contains the initialized
            transition probabilities
            M: Number of hidden states
        Emission: numpy.ndarray shape (M, N) that contains the initialized
            emission probabilities
            N: Number of output states
        Initial: numpy.ndarray shape (M, 1) that contains the initialized
            starting probabilities
        iterations:
            Number of times expectation-maximation should be performed

    Returns:
        Converted Transition, Emission matrices, or None, None on failure
